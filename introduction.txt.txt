Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Adeline Uwizeyimana, a passionate learner with a background in history, economics, and geography. I am currently exploring opportunities in freelancing and virtual assistance, and I’m deeply committed to solving real-world challenges—especially those related to agriculture and climate change.

I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to meaningful problems. Whether it's working on data, entrepreneurship ideas, or academic projects, I strive to make a positive impact in my community. I’m also fluent in Kinyarwanda and love helping others grow in their skills and knowledge.
